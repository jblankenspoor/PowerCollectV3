### Visual Layout and Structure

**Header Section:**
- The application has a header with the title "PowerCollectV3" in large, bold text
- Below the title is a descriptive subtitle: "Build tables visually and generate Power FX code for Power Apps collections"

**DataTable Component:**
- The table has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle borders
- Column headers are displayed in a light gray background with uppercase text
- The table contains the following columns (from left to right):
  1. SELECT column (centered) with checkboxes for row selection
  2. NAME column (left-aligned) displaying task names
  3. STATUS column (left-aligned) showing status indicators with color coding
  4. PRIORITY column (left-aligned) with priority levels and color coding
  5. START DATE column (left-aligned) displaying dates
  6. DEADLINE column (left-aligned) displaying dates
  7. ACTIONS column (centered) with action buttons

**Column Action Row:**
- Below the header row is a row with column action buttons
- Each column has up/down arrow icons for sorting
- The Select column's action row is centered, matching the header alignment

**Table Rows:**
- Each row represents a task with the following sample data:
  1. "Quarterly launch" with "Done" status (green), "Low" priority, dates "17 februari 2025" and "20 februari 2025"
  2. "Customer research" with "In progress" status (yellow), "Medium" priority, dates "21 februari 2025" and "24 februari 2025"
  3. "Campaign analysis" with "To do" status (red), "High" priority, dates "25 februari 2025" and "28 februari 2025"
- Status cells have color-coded backgrounds: green for "Done", yellow for "In progress", red for "To do"
- Priority cells have color-coded backgrounds: green for "Low", yellow for "Medium", red for "High"

**Action Buttons:**
- Each row has action buttons in the rightmost column
- The action buttons include a plus icon (for adding a column) and a trash icon (for deleting the row)
- These buttons are centered in the Actions column

**Add Row Functionality:**
- At the bottom of the table is a blue "+ Add row" button that spans the width of the table
- This button allows users to add new rows to the table

**Generate Power FX Button:**
- Below the table is a prominent button labeled "Generate Power FX"
- This button likely generates Power FX code based on the table data for use in Power Apps

**Scroll Notification:**
- When the table width exceeds the viewport, a scroll notification appears
- This notification indicates to users that they can scroll horizontally to see more content
- The notification disappears once the user begins scrolling or reaches the end of the scrollable content
- It's designed to be subtle but noticeable, likely appearing at the edge of the visible table area

**Visual Styling:**
- The interface uses a clean, professional color scheme with blue accents for interactive elements
- Text is well-spaced and legible with appropriate font sizes for different elements
- The overall design follows modern UI principles with adequate whitespace and clear visual hierarchy
